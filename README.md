## Project Title

**Curriculum & Business Forecasting Tool**

---

## Project Summary

This project focuses on developing an **AI/ML‑driven forecasting tool** to predict future learner numbers and funding for **Further Education (FE) colleges**. The tool leverages historical enrolment, funding data, and related metrics, combined with national and regional **Labour Market Information (LMI)**.

Predictive models built through this project will support FE colleges in planning resources and programmes more efficiently and effectively. The project offers hands‑on experience in applying data science and machine learning techniques within a real‑world educational and policy‑driven context.

---

## Technologies Used

The project involves the following technologies and tools:

* **Snowflake** – Data storage and management
* **SQL** – Data querying
* **Python** – Data processing and analysis
* **Python Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
* **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Flask** – Web application framework for deploying models and building APIs
* **Web Development** – Interactive web application for delivering forecasts and insights
* **Data Scraping** – External data integration
* **Power BI** – Data visualisation and dashboard creation

---

## Objectives of the Project

The key objectives include:

* Developing accurate predictive models for forecasting learner enrolment trends in FE colleges
* Analysing historical data to identify factors influencing learner numbers and funding (e.g., demographics, sector subject areas, occupational routes)
* Creating a user‑friendly dashboard to deliver forecasts to colleges
* Supporting improved resource allocation and strategic planning through data‑driven insights

---

## The Data

Quadrant Insights holds comprehensive datasets sourced from multiple FE colleges, stored securely in **Snowflake**. The data spans several years and includes:

* Learner numbers and enrolment history
* Funding data
* Student demographics (age, region)
* Course types and subject areas
* Achievement, retention, and completion rates

All datasets used in this project are **fully anonymised** and **GDPR‑compliant**. Sensitive information related to the job and labour market data—such as names of individual colleges, addresses, institutional identifiers, and any other personally or commercially sensitive details—has been removed or masked to ensure confidentiality and ethical data usage.

## Technical Skills Required

To successfully complete the project, the following technical skills are essential:

* Proficiency in **SQL** for querying Snowflake databases
* Strong **Python** programming and data manipulation skills (pandas, NumPy)
* Knowledge of **machine learning algorithms**, including regression and time‑series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
* Experience with **scikit‑learn** and **TensorFlow/Keras**
* Data visualisation skills using **Power BI**
* Basic understanding of statistics and data preprocessing techniques

---

## Project Progress

The project is structured on a **weekly basis**, with detailed documentation maintained for each week. Progress, tasks, and findings can be accessed through the following README files:

* **Week 01:** [Data Understanding & Exploratory Data Analysis](/Week01)
